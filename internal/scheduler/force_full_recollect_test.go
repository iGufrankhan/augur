// Force-recollect (v0.18.24): scheduler-side contract for the flag that
// was added to collection_queue. Two behaviors:
//
//   - determineSince must return zero time (full collection) when the
//     job row's ForceFullCollect flag is set, regardless of whether the
//     repo was previously collected.
//   - shouldForceFullRecollect inspects a CompleteJob error string and
//     returns true when the failure class is one of the GraphQL-batch
//     shapes that leaves PR child data incomplete (stream CANCEL,
//     validation timeout, retry exhaustion). Those are the observed
//     2026-04-22 production errors that motivated this feature.
